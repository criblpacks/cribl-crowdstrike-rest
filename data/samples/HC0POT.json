The account in question, \\\"MSCORE,\\\" had not been used for a significant period, as indicated by the last password set date in 2017 and the recent successful login in 2025. While the reactivation of a stale account can be a sign of unauthorized access or a compromised account, it can also occur due to legitimate reasons such as an employee returning from a long leave or a system administrator reactivating the account for maintenance purposes. The account lacks admin privileges, reducing the immediate risk, and the login was interactive, suggesting it might have been a legitimate user action. Given these factors, the detection does not provide enough context to definitively classify it as either a true positive or a false positive, leading to an inconclusive verdict.\",\n    \"triage_recommendation\": \"escalate\",\n    \"recommend_host_containment\": false,\n    \"escalation_priority\": 149,\n    \"advancement_probable\": false,\n    \"advancement_probable_confidence\": 20\n   },\n   \"cid\": \"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\",\n   \"composite_id\": \"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa:ind:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa:AAAAAAAA-0000-4382-9700-BBBBBBBBBBBB\",\n   \"confidence\": 20,\n   \"context_timestamp\": \"2025-09-24T23:58:20.432Z\",\n   \"crawled_timestamp\": \"2025-09-25T00:03:21.960579281Z\",\n   \"created_timestamp\": \"2025-09-24T23:59:21.957101448Z\",\n   \"data_domains\": [\n    \"Identity\"\n   ],\n   \"description\": \"A stale user became active\",\n   \"display_name\": \"Use of stale user account\",\n   \"end_time\": \"2025-09-24T23:58:20.432Z\",\n   \"falcon_host_link\": \"https://falcon.us-2.crowdstrike.com/identity-protection/detections/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa:ind:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa:AAAAAAAA-0000-4382-9700-BBBBBBBBBBBB?_cid=00000000000000000000000000000000\",\n   \"id\": \"ind:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa:AAAAAAAA-0000-4382-9700-BBBBBBBBBBBB\",\n   \"mitre_attack\": [\n    {\n     \"pattern_id\": 51130,\n     \"tactic_id\": \"TA0001\",\n     \"technique_id\": \"T1078\",\n     \"tactic\": \"Initial Access\",\n     \"technique\": \"Valid Accounts\"\n    }\n   ],\n   \"most_recent_activity_time_stamp\": \"2025-09-24T23:57:38.629Z\",\n   \"name\": \"StaleUserAccountUsage\",\n   \"objective\": \"Gain Access\",\n   \"pattern_id\": 51130,\n   \"poly_id\": \"BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBj5UXh7zsYQoeyUA5IhYiXHGmW7QAATiHIVOgBxbH54I2NZysTjlCNE80N0Jmk3bWtn-AAAAAAAA==\",\n   \"preceding_activity_time_stamp\": \"2025-04-08T19:18:28.786Z\",\n   \"product\": \"idp\",\n   \"scenario\": \"suspicious_activity\",\n   \"seconds_to_resolved\": 0,\n   \"seconds_to_triaged\": 0,\n   \"severity\": 10,\n   \"severity_name\": \"Informational\",\n   \"show_in_ui\": true,\n   \"source_account_domain\": \"AFOS.IO\",\n   \"source_account_name\": \"MSCORE\",\n   \"source_account_object_guid\": \"AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA\",\n   \"source_account_object_sid\": \"S-0-0-00-000000000-000000000-000000000-123456\",\n   \"source_account_sam_account_name\": \"MSCORE\",\n   \"source_products\": [\n    \"Falcon Identity Protection\"\n   ],\n   \"source_vendors\": [\n    \"CrowdStrike\"\n   ],\n   \"start_time\": \"2025-09-24T23:58:20.432Z\",\n   \"status\": \"new\",\n   \"tactic\": \"Initial Access\",\n   \"tactic_id\": \"TA0001\",\n   \"technique\": \"Valid Accounts\",\n   \"technique_id\": \"T1078\",\n   \"timestamp\": \"2025-09-24T23:58:20.512Z\",\n   \"type\": \"idp-user-endpoint-app-info\",\n   \"updated_timestamp\": \"2025-09-25T00:03:21.960562979Z\",\n   \"user_name\": \"MSCORE\"\n  }","host":"ip-10-255-9-252","source":"https://api.us-2.crowdstrike.com/alerts/entities/alerts/v2","_time":1758758361.957,"cribl_breaker":["Crowdstrike API Ruleset:Crowdstrike_Alerts","ndjson"]}]
